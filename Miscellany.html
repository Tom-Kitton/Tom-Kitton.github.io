<h2>I. GEOGRAPHY</h2> 
<h3>THE MILLES DESTOINNE-LEMONS HILL ROAD</h3>
<p>
Lemon’s Hill is eleven hours’ hard walking from the Customs House. The road is hardpacked earth, much used by herders and traders. It is well marked with mileboards, and post houses are set at the main crossroads. The largest post house is Prester Tom’s, a meeting place for people from all around, which sits at the outer gate of Brownrigg, right where the road to the Foundation of Bau Terres separates from the main path. Famous and rich, Bau Terres may be reached from Brownrigg, via Kiels, in as little as two hours. The twin villages of Brownrigg and Kiels are famous for their fne food and apple orchards, as well as a beautiful Chancel house from the time of the Dukes du Willette, and the manse of Fell Martyn, country seat of the chief inspector of the Chanchette division of the queen’s courts.
</p>

<h3>PATIENCES, NOTES OF ENTRY AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR STRANGERS ENTERING THE QUEENS CHAIN</h3>
<p>
Patiences for strangers, those born outside the lands of the Queen’s chain, are issued by the officers of the Queen’s Customs and the Beadles of the Queen’s Inspectorates, upon the instruction of an agent of the crown of no lesser rank than a frst inspector of customs, or upon the fnding of a full session of a court of contest. Patiences for the subjects of the queen are issued upon birth, accession or denigration, by their local offce of the Queen’s chancel. The patiences of subjects may be varied upon the fnding of a full session of a court of contest, with a right of appeal to the fnding department’s offce of rolls.
The lowest degree of patience for strangers, a note of entry, is coloured with a red seal and entered into a stranger’s pass at the outer borders. A stranger bearing a note of entry may not leave a stranger’s hall or a place of customs without the supervision and warranty of a duly authorised person. Such persons include beadles of the rank of petty watch master and higher, recorders of a court of contest, justices at large, or strangers with a patience of free standing. The bearer of a note of entry is not entitled to the protection of the Queen’s courts of contest, save in lieu of the otherwise recognised standing of their warrantor. They have no right to call upon the Queen’s servants for protection.
A patience of free standing is only available to the authorised agents of recognised foreign  powers which stand in peaceful and deferential recognition of Her Majesty, so as to further the bonds of respect which tie them to her good guidance. It is sealed in Blue by a chief inspector of customs and countersealed in orange by a petty chancellor or higher offceholder of Her Majesty’s chancelleries. A patience of free standing allows the holder to move without restriction in the Queen’s chain and to appeal to offcers of the departments, inspectorates and courts of contest with the same privileges as a subject of free standing would enjoy. Most strangers in the Queen’s chain receive a patience of due recognition, sealed in purple by a petty inspector of customs, which allows for free movement in the Queen’s chain, so as the stranger reports to the stranger’s hall of any town upon their arrival, and offers the protection of Her Majesty’s servants at their good discretion and elect wish.

<h3>THE TOWN OF LEMONS HILL</h3>
<p>
Lemon’s hill is the chief town of the Cope’s Water valley and the home of learning, politics, law, and crime for a dozen leagues in any direction. Though Kiels is the notional seat of the Chanchette inspectorate, true political and legal authority in the country resides with the Greater Chancel at Lemon’s Hill, which has long controlled the offce of Inspector in subtle, and less than subtle, ways. It is said that though the beadles of the Cope’s Water may swear oaths to the Queen and her inspector on high holidays, they swear by the chief chancellor of Lemon’s Hill, the formidable Madame Diept, when they are in their cups.
</p>
<h3>THE VIEW OF MR. KIEHLRING</h3>
<p>
“The town of Lemons Hill is the principal settlement of the Chanchette inspectorate. Ancestral seat of the Greyfelds, du Lienns and Heryotts, it is home to many fne buildings, including a foundation school from the time of the Dukes de Willette. Its most picturesque views and constructions may be found along Charterhouse Walk, which follows the banks of Copes Water through the town's oldest sections. In this illustration, we see the school of Bay Bells and the Merrypitt customs store, seated amongst abundant greenery and the diminutive residences of the towns labouring classes. The hills in the further distance are the lower extensions of Mallos ranges, locally referred to as "The Flanks of the Boar" in deference to the sigil of the Heryott family, who have long held the frstsecretaryship associated with the Chancette Division in the Queen's Courts" From <i>Florian Kiehlring's "Observations of a Traveller and Antiquarian in the Country of Cope's Water and its Near Lands", frst published by Stowe and Daughters, Doctors Commons of Ontaigne, ER 323, p.489, fg. 3.</i>
</p>
<h3>THE EMMSLEE FENS</h3>
<p>
The Emmslee fens lie to the North of Bray Tor and to the East of Coun Glaer, bounded upon their other extremities by the greystone fngers of the Tee'Ehlen Range.
Nominally subject to the authority of the the reconstructed marchionetcy of Westhithe and the Duriett division of the queen's courts, the fens have been only slackly peopled and indifferently inspected since the collapse of the old duchy.
The fens are an unforgiving country, full of strangling bogs and foul airs, dangerous to the slack-witted or unwary, and without agricultural advantages. They have long been a redoubt of brigands and thieves and have rarely known stable government or civility. Even at the height of the Merrywater courts, the notion that taxes might be levied upon the fens, or that commerce worthy of such attention might be carried out by their ill-famed inhabitants, was a standing joke everywhere from the penny press to the chancellor's table.
The only town of any signifcance within the borders of the Emmslee waters is Thrope Orkyn, a dreary collection of tumbledown houses built in the rustic, pitchdown style native to the fens, and hemmed in on all sides by stinking felds of geese. 
The keeping of fowls is the town's only industry, save for smuggling and sly gin, and the hooting screams of its avian denizens are enough to chase sleep from even the weariest of heads. 
From <i>"A Gazetteer of the Duriett and Coppe au Liemme Divisions in the time of our Queen, Her Grace Merie, the fourth of her name, formerly Lady Winsomer", published in Conjunction by the Offces of the Beadles in Cabinet of the Duriett and Coppe au Liemme Divisions of Her Majesty's Courts of Contest, ER 403, p. 220.</i></p>
<h3>THE TOWN OF ODERDRIT</h3>
<p>
Nutmeg Street is the principal thoroughfare of Oderdrit, in the inspectorate of Estilling. A small and prosperous town, founded in the second year of the Westhithe secession, Oderdrit owes its wealth primarily to the commanding position it occupies above the delta of Cope's Water, which has set it up
most admirably as a centre for the taxation of the commerce which swarms upon that great thoroughfare. 
Visible in the rear of this engraving is the town's queer, double-peaked almshouse and its similarly whimsical schoolstower. Both are thought to be the work of Leon Dufelt, a mason of great local fame and frankly eccentric creativity who thrived in the late years of the Hilliers regency. Excepting these singular edifices, Nutmeg Street is further notable for the beauty of its deep, fowler-set cobbles and the whimsical monument, recently erected by the town's chancellors, which lists the distances from the head of Nutmeg Street to all the great offces elsewhere in the monarchy." 
From <i>"A Treatise on the Great Houses and Foundations of the Old Borders" by Erienne Au Ffabre, third Marchess Oldwater, frst published by Doncastre & Penney, Doctors Commons of Estoc, ER 356, p. 412, fg. 5.</i>
</p>
<h3>THE DEPARTMENT OF ONCHATS</h3>
<p>
Poor and benighted, the little-visited department of Onchats lies to the North of the Mallos gorges, a country of soft ash soil and thick pine woods, perpetually soaked by the copious rain which descends upon it from the heights. The region is undercut by a veritable warren of limestone caves, scarce explored and the subject of superstitious horror on the part of the local people. These unstable stones give rise to an overlying confusion of ravines and gulches, interspersed with bottomless pits, which shift themselves into new formations with the changing seasons, making travel arduous and settled agriculture almost impossible. 
It is for this reason that the few rustics who inhabit Onchats' scattered and poor villages live, in the main, by hunting and by selling queer carvings made of limestone and wood to their richer and more decadent neighbours. Although this hard country lies within the inspectorate of Bay Bells, none of its settlements is of a size to play host to any offces of the Queen's business, and the nearest outpost of her infuence lies in Brieste, a trading town of some importance within the adjacent inspectorate of Du Tropf, where the denizens of Onchats habitually ply their meagre trades." 
From <i>"A View of Ontaigne, Du Tropf, and Bay Bells from the Mallos and Twenty-Five More Sights to Gladden a Weary Pilgrim" by Chief Beadle (ret.) Williem de Lancey, frst published by Egren and Company, Court of Ontaigne, ER 367, p. 431, fg. 1.</i>
</p>
<h3>THE HILLIERS LINE AND THE OLD DUCHIES OF WESTHITHE AND DULSUILLE </h3>
<p>
The ruins of a customs magazine, situated above Loen Cove in the country of Westhithe. The oldest stones in the ruin are cut in the same crude manner as those used in the foundations of nearby Clothe Merryn, suggesting great antiquity in the fort's original construction. The later fortifcations and expansions are fne examples of the
Southern style of the time of Merrywaters, in this case attributed to Leann du March, whose most celebrated construction is certainly the Black Horse aqueduct, near Tuille. Though now much decayed, the fort is a pride of the nearby village of Rooksmere and must be agreed to offer a fearfully romantic prospect. The profusion of such ruins along the old Hilliere line Is one of the chief recommendations of travel in this district, as so many of the proud edifces which stood in that country were brought low in the unhappy days that attended to the fall of the old Duchy of Westhithe." From <i>"Reminiscences on the Passage of a Vagabonding Life and Refections Upon Mine Own Many Sins" by Joan Terries, 12th Marquis Terriette and frst secretary for the borders, frst published by Leemings and Doel, Courts of Clove March, ER 276, p. 1243, fg. 1. </i>

<h3>YTOILE DECKS AND ORRERY CARDS</h3>
<p>
A deck produced after the Ytoile pattern of orrery cards will hold ffty six distinct fgures, arranged into the commons and cloisters of four suits as well as the unsuited cards of the great chains. The most common designations of the four suits of the Ytoile pattern are Bones, Sight, Mind and Stars, with the commons of each suit being numbered from one to seven. These are succeeded in each suit, in ascending order of rank, by the Page, the Marchioness, the Chancellor and the Queen. The remaining twelve cards of the great chain are commonly removed when playing burdens and graces but are used in casting orreries and in Old Emm’s Taking, a game played in the Emmslee Fens. The names on the cards of the great chain vary with each printing, but are commonly patterned after the religious and mathematical beliefs of the set’s designer. Common designations for these cards include the prime graces, the fgures of the Tale of Loen’s Falling, the Offces of the Fellowship of the Undying, the principal phases of indestructible matter, and the aspects of the deep lady. The
meaning of these cards may be interpreted by the caster in a wild profusion of different ways, whose variability and apparent perversity had led many to condemn the casting of orreries as a mere trickery akin to the three cup game.

<h2>III. FANCIE ARTS</h2> 
<h3>MADAMOISELLE DELIGIORI'S VIEWS OF THE EMPTY CITY</h3>
<p>
“Madamoiselle Delligiori's "Views of the Empty City" is a slender folio of thirty-two engravings, all executed in a striking and individual style, which was frst issued by the small printing house of Iowen Dappier and Company, in the city of Ecsmere. As an example of the engraver's art, it has many merits, even when considered against the exacting standards of Mlle. Delligiori's antecedents in the traditional mode of fgure cutting, which reached its utmost perfection in the early years of the time of Willette. The sensation which was occasioned by the frst publication of this volume was quite out of proportion to these artistic accomplishments, however, and turned instead on the unusual contents of the images, as well as the frankly extraordinary circumstances of Mlle. Delligiori's short life.
Delligiori was born into a family of paper cutters in the town of On-Ysoir, where she lived in happy industry until her twenty
second year, when a bout of Maevern's Flue took her sight and health in one fell stroke. From that time on, Mlle Delligiori lived under the protection of the Fellowship of the Graces, who taught her to work the higher symmetries and sing changes in the Foundation House of Mille Chats. Though Delligiori was, by all accounts, happy in her new place, so far as it is possible to be happy when one has been struck so harshly by ill fate, she was also much troubled by strange dreams, which largely comprised of walking through a vast and empty city built of yellow stone, in a style reminiscent of the ruined bastions of Cloth Merryn. More surprising than the dreams themselves was the strong compulsion to activity which accompanied them; calling on the engraving skills she had learnt in her youth, Mlle. Delligiori began to cut vast numbers of pictures that illustrated her wanderings in that lonely place.
Unsettling though they are, these images have held an enduring fascination for students of history, occultation and the symmetries, given the unusual architectural, geometric and decorative properties they display. It has been strongly argued that the drawings, and Mlle. Delligiori's remarkable achievement in creating them while deprived of the gift of sight, constitute one of the most recent manifestations of the graces upon earth, while others believe them to be proof of the power of third sight. Mlle Delligiori's drawings were only published
after her death at the age of sixty-seven, so her views on these matters are not known. The deacon of her fellow-house was, however, recorded as saying that she had always seemed happy and relieved when cutting these pictures, and was proud of the admiration they commanded among her friends at Milles Chats, where she was a prized and much adored companion."

<h3>
PENNYFRIGHT PLAYS, PIEMEN AND THE POOR THEATRE</h3>
<p>
Plate III shews an illustration of the ill-fated Loen House, setting for "The Merrie House of Cantle Rise. A Tragedie of Three Base Killings, a Wise Turn and thee Noose", by Yvette Duftte, one of the more colourful and enduring pennyfright plays of last century. First published by the politically radical Stowe and Daughters, Thee Merrie House remains unusual for its advocacy of toleration towards the citizens of Westhithe resident in her majesty's domains, following the then-recent collapse of the Grey Duchy. Ceaselessly cast as villains and agitators in most literature of the period, Westhitians receive a more rounded portrayal in Duftte's play, working and getting on, and even assisting the chief Beadle in his discovery of a band of murderous smugglers from the fen country. This illustration was frst printed as a plate in the play's second edition,
released in February of ER 361. It is thought to either a less distinguished example of Yves Betten's later style or the work of one of his many imitators in Du Rhenc's bustling
bohemian quarter. From <i>"Pennyfrights to Paupers Play" by Milliette Oderbrink, frst published by Distriopethies Pappers, Foundation Presses of Duesselbending, ER 419, p. 201.</i>
