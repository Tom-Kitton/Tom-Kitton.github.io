								A Cloud Forest. A cloud forest would be a UG tapland that you could tap and bounce to tap a creature. The image is based on a photo I snapped out the window while driving towards the Mangamuka Range in Northlnd, while on holiday with my family. The morning was misty, with the coulds of haze punctured by burning-hot su. I was still learning to drive, and the rays would scatter off the filthy windscreen at every corner, making me squint like mad and slow down to about 15km/h.
