Welcome to a Traveller's Way
</h2>
<p>
Click <a href="Miscellany.html
">here</a> to read <i>HOOK's MISCELLANY</i>, an irreverent survey of the present condition of the lands of Chanchette, Du Riett and Du Tropf. <i>Hook's Miscellany</i> was presented and conceived as a satire on the legendarily pompous <i>Gazette of the Queen's Chain</i>, prepared annually by Tobias Alledora Gaesmeade for more than three decades during the reign of Queen Meriett VII.

">here</a> to read the descriptions of the many counties and divisions of the Queen's Chain. The diverse lands which make up our well-esteemed commonwealth are exceedingly various in their climates, histories and manners; bewware the traveller who confuses the politics of Laurence with those of La Rhenc! These informative pieces are culled from the better editions of the <i>Gazette of The Queen's Chain</i>, as well as the privately produced reminiscences of the more observant sort of traveller.
